### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leen Zhu, you can call me Leen for short.

I love programing with the following languages:

- C/C++
- Go
- Python
- Javascript/Typescript
- Lua

Here is my favorite code I ever wrote:

```c
while(life--) money++;
```

My favorite editor is VIM, sometimes I use VSCode on Windows.
